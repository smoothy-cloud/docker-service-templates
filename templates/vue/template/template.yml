      - variable: paths_to_shared_libraries
        label: Paths to shared libraries
        hint: >
          Some services require, in addition to their source code, the presence of a shared library 
          that is stored in the Git repository outside of the source directory. For example
          in "libraries/ui-components/" instead of "services/vue/". If your service depends on
          one or more shared libraries, you should specify their paths in the Git repository here.
