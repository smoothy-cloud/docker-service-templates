      - name: Path to Vue.js source code
        description: >
          The directory in your Git repository that contains the source code of your service.
        variable: path_to_source_code

        type: file_path
        default: ''

      - name: Paths to shared libraries
        description: >
          Some services require, in addition to their source code, the presence of a shared library 
          that is stored in the Git repository outside of the source directory. For example
          in "libraries/ui-components/" instead of "services/vue/". If your service depends on
          one or more shared libraries, you should specify their paths in the Git repository here.
